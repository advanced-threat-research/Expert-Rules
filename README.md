Description: A deep description of the purpose of the rule, techniques covered, stuff and actions that are supposed to be blocked by the use of the rule.

Rule TCL: The rule TCL code that can be directly used in the ENS Exploit Prevention policy. Something like:

Rule {
    Process {
        Include Match_Type { -v ... }
        Exclude Match_Type { -v ... }
    }
    Target {
        Match Match_Object {
            Include Match_Type { -v ... }
            Exclude Match_Type { -v ... }
            Include -access ...
        }
    }
}
Trigger: Some steps to trigger the rule and verify that it actually works. You can put a reference here to any public and safe tool.
